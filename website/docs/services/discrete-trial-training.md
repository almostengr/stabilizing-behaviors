Discrete Trial Training (DTT) is a structured teaching method that breaks learning into small, manageable tasks. This approach utilizes a clear and consistent framework to teach skills in a systematic way. Each trial consists of three components: the instruction, the response from the child, and the feedback or reinforcement. This method is particularly effective for children with autism as it allows for focused learning in a controlled environment. By employing positive reinforcement strategies, we help children understand the connection between their responses and the outcomes, encouraging them to engage actively in the learning process.

DTT is tailored to meet each child's unique needs and learning styles. Our trained professionals assess the child's abilities and create individualized programs that target specific skills, such as communication, social interaction, and daily living skills. As the child progresses, the complexity of the tasks is gradually increased to promote independence and confidence. This structured yet flexible approach ensures that children not only learn new skills but also develop a sense of achievement and motivation to continue their educational journey.
