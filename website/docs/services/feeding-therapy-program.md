Our feeding therapy program is designed to introduce children to new foods and expand their dietary preferences, particularly focusing on fruits and vegetables that they may initially dislike. We understand that many children with autism can be selective eaters, and our program aims to make food exploration a positive and engaging experience. Through fun activities, such as taste tests, cooking demonstrations, and hands-on meal preparation, we create a supportive environment that encourages children to try new foods without pressure.

We also focus on the sensory aspects of food, helping children become more comfortable with different textures, colors, and flavors. Our trained staff guides children through the process of trying new foods, celebrating small victories and offering encouragement. By normalizing the experience of trying new foods, we aim to promote healthier eating habits and increase overall nutritional intake. This program not only supports children in developing a more diverse diet but also helps them build confidence and reduce anxiety around food.
