Natural Environment Teaching (NET) focuses on teaching skills in real-world contexts, allowing children to learn through their daily activities and interactions. This method emphasizes the importance of naturalistic settings, where children can practice newly acquired skills in familiar environments, such as at home, in the community, or during playtime. By integrating learning into everyday situations, we encourage children to generalize their skills across different contexts, making them more functional and applicable to their lives.

In NET, our trained professionals facilitate learning opportunities by using the child's interests and motivations to engage them effectively. For example, during a trip to the grocery store, a child may practice requesting items, counting, or identifying colors in a natural and enjoyable setting. This hands-on approach not only makes learning more enjoyable but also helps children develop essential life skills, such as communication and social interaction. Our goal is to create meaningful learning experiences that foster independence and confidence, enabling children to thrive in their communities.
